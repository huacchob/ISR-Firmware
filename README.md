# ISR-Firmware

Here is the script used to upgrade firmware on ISR devices
When using this script, you also need to create two files in the same directory this file is placed in
1. IP.txt - All IPs will be placed in this file
2. Error.txt - This file should be empty, but all devices that have an error, their IP will be added to this file

When you run this script, make sure you change your directory to the directory where the script was uploaded to

Before you run the script, replace username with your username login and passowrd/secret with your password
